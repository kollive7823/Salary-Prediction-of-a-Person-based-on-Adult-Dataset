# Salary-Prediction-of-a-Person-based-on-Adult-Dataset

This paper is focused on building a
predictive model on adult dataset by
implementing various machine learning
algorithms which can accurately identify
individuals whose salary exceeds a
specified value. Applying the concepts of
machine learning algorithms such as
Logistic Regression, Support Vector
Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors and Neural
Networks on Adult dataset, the hidden
patterns can be derived by building a
predictive model. Upon building the
models, the performance of the model is
evaluated, and the efficiency of the
algorithms applied on this dataset are
compared.
